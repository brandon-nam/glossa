# Glossa

Glossa is a Korean policy change tracker to help Christians understand the changes better with simple explanations and relevant bible verses and Christian point of view to provide directions to think about.

Glossa means tongue in Koine Greek, used to describe gift of tongue. I believe that we Christians need to start speaking in our heavenly language to make voices about the societal issues that may impact our friends', family's, and loved ones' daily lives.
